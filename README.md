## Features
* Direct Messages: Message your developer friends without leaving the text editor.
* Secure: You can only message devs whom you follow and they follow you back on GitHub.
* Distraction-free: Having your code in front of you always, and never opening a social media app while still achieving the purpose justifies this.
